# Essential Gene Conservation
An investigation into the conservation and loss of essential genes across the bacterial phylogeny. 

Three jupyter notebooks depict the preliminary investigation performed here. 

1. E_coli_Essential_Gene_Compilation.ipynb
This notebook contains the determination of an essential gene list in *Escherichia coli* through prior investigations that employ targeted knockout approaches, as well as tnSeq, and CRISPRi.

2. B_subtilis_Essential_Gene_Compilation.ipynb
Here the essential gene list of *Bacillus subtilis* is compiled through three previously published datasets that apply targeted knockout approaches and CRISPRi.

3. OrthoDB_GeneFinding.ipynb
To search for orthologs, the ortholog database was obtained from OrthoDB then manually searched for the relevant essential genes, to create a list of essential orthologous groups for *B. subtilis* and *E. coli*.
