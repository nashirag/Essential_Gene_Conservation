# Essential Gene Conservation
An investigation into the conservation and loss of essential genes across the bacterial phylogeny. 

Three jupyter notebooks depict the preliminary investigation performed here. 

1. E_coli_Essential_Gene_Compilation.ipynb
This notebook contains the determination of an essential gene list in *Escherichia coli* through prior investigations that employ targeted knockout approaches, as well as tnSeq, and CRISPRi.

2. B_subtilis_Essential_Gene_Compilation.ipynb
Here the essential gene list of *Bacillus subtilis* is compiled through three previously published datasets that apply targeted knockout approaches and CRISPRi.

3. OrthoDB_GeneFinding.ipynb
To search for orthologs, the ortholog database was obtained from OrthoDB then manually searched for the relevant essential genes, to create a list of essential orthologous groups for *B. subtilis* and *E. coli*. As the files were too large to be included, please refer to OrthoDB to obtain source files, then utilize the notebook to recreate the resulting datasets.

We refer users to the readme.txt for environment requirements to successfully run these notebooks.
